# Classification of Tweets using Deep Learning Models
## Project Overview
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of tweets using deep learning techniques. The goal is to classify tweets into three sentiment categories: positive, negative, or neutral. The project leverages a dataset of over 50,000 tweets collected from various sources between 2013 and 2016.
## Feature Extraction
We used pre-trained word embeddings to enhance model performance.
- GloVe
- Word2Vec
- fastText

## Models used
Five machine learning models were used for the classification of the tweets:
1. MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)
2. CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
3. BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory)
4. CNN + LSTM (Hybrid Convolutional-Recurrent Model)

## Results
CNN models acheived the highest best performance among all models.
